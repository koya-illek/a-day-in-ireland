# A Day in Ireland 2.0

A living, near-real-time portrait of weather, water, energy and movement across Ireland.

## Data

- Met Éireann observations, warnings and five-minute rainfall-radar tiles, licensed under CC BY 4.0.
- Marine Institute offshore weather buoys, coastal observatories, real-time tide gauges, predicted high/low water and storm-surge guidance, licensed under CC BY 4.0.
- Iarnród Éireann current train positions.
- OPW near-real-time river gauges, licensed under CC BY 4.0.
- EirGrid all-island operational demand, generation, wind, carbon, frequency and interconnection data.
- EEA up-to-date monitoring-station air quality, alongside Open-Meteo fields derived from the CAMS regional model. Measurements and model estimates are explicitly distinguished.
- NOAA SWPC OVATION aurora probability and planetary K-index guidance.
- EPA active bathing-water restrictions and advisories, licensed under CC BY 4.0.
- NASA GIBS VIIRS near-real-time true-colour imagery.
- USGS detected earthquakes from the previous seven days around Ireland.
- CelesTrak ISS orbital elements, with 48-hour passes calculated locally for central Ireland.
- NTA GTFS-Realtime vehicle positions when an `NTA_API_KEY` production environment variable is configured.
- Solar position and daylight state are calculated locally.

Weather, radar and the additional island contexts refresh every five minutes; train positions refresh every minute. OPW normally publishes river levels about every fifteen minutes, and deployed readings automatically expire after three hours if an upstream refresh is unavailable. Marine observations expire after six hours. Missing or stale values are not represented as zero.

The NTA integration is credential-aware: without `NTA_API_KEY`, the UI explains that developer access is required and never substitutes scheduled or historical positions. Create a free key at [developer.nationaltransport.ie](https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/), then store it as a secret production environment variable in Sites and publish a new version.
